## CS6140 Project Wine Quality Prediction

This project is to evaluate the KNN/Neural Network/Gradient Boosting Tree multi classifiers and choose the best one to determin the importance of feature for wine quality prediction.

The Gradient Boosting Classifier has the best f1-score 86% and was used to determin feature importance.
